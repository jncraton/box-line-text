FAQ
---

### How do I save?

Diagram state is stored in the URL, so any method of saving a URL can be used to save your work. In most browsers, you also can save the page as an HTML file. This should save your diagram and allow you to pick up where you left off. Screenshots and/or screen recordings may also be used to save your work.

### Is there a way to make the diagram larger or smaller?

Native zoom in your browser is supported and should work for this purpose.

### Can I make the diagram fill my entire screen?

Yes. Full screen mode is supported. You can enter full screen mode as you normally would in your browser (perhaps by pressing F11).
